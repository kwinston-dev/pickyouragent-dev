# Domain Decision Record: `pickyouragent.dev`

**Date:** 2025-11-30  
**Project:** Comparison site for AI coding agents

---

## 1. Decision

The primary domain for the project is:

> **`pickyouragent.dev`**

This will be used as the main public entry point for the site and future related materials (docs, guides, etc.).

---

## 2. Project context

The site focuses on:

- Comparing **AI coding agents** in a **single, structured table**.
- Highlighting and explaining **which features each agent has**.
- Providing **justification for why each feature matters** in modern software development (planning, reasoning visibility, tests, tooling, etc.).
- Helping developers make an **informed choice** of agent based on their actual workflow and constraints.

The site is aimed primarily at **developers** and **technical users**.

---

## 3. Options considered

### Shortlist

- **`pickyouragent.dev`** ✅ (chosen)
- **`pickagent.dev`**  
- **`chooseyouragent.dev`**

### Other conceptual directions (not chosen)

- **`knowyouragent.dev`**
- **`dontcodealone.dev`**
- **`codewithagents.dev`**
- **`upgradeyouragent.dev`**

These were useful to clarify the brand direction (education + comparison), but not selected as the main domain.

---

## 4. Reasons for choosing `pickyouragent.dev`

### 4.1 Natural, idiomatic English

- The phrase **“pick your agent”** sounds like a normal, fluent imperative in English.
- It can be directly reused in UI and marketing copy (headlines, buttons) without modification.
- By contrast, **“pick agent”** feels grammatically incomplete and more “machine-like” to native speakers.

**Consequence:** The domain itself can double as a short, clear product message.

---

### 4.2 Personal and developer-oriented tone

- The word **“your”** makes the message personal: the site helps you find **your** agent, not just “some” agent.
- This aligns well with the goal: the user compares tools and ends up with an agent (or stack of agents) that fits their **own** workflow and constraints.
- It matches the idea of agents as **partners in development**, not just generic utilities.

**Consequence:** The brand supports the narrative “build your own toolbelt of agents”.

---

### 4.3 Strong call-to-action matching the product

- The core user flow is: **open site → compare agents in the table → understand features → pick an agent**.
- The verb **“pick”** directly reflects this behavior and sets the expectation that the site is about **choice**, not just news or documentation.
- The domain supports CTAs like:
  - “Pick your coding agent with confidence”
  - “Pick your agent based on how you really work”

**Consequence:** The domain and the main interaction are tightly aligned.

---

### 4.4 Better balance than `pickagent.dev`

- **`pickagent.dev`** is shorter, but:
  - it reads less naturally in English;
  - it feels more abstract and less user-focused;
  - it’s harder to reuse as a sentence in copy.
- **`pickyouragent.dev`** trades a few extra characters for:
  - more natural language;
  - a friendlier tone;
  - immediate clarity.

**Consequence:** Preference is given to clarity and “human-ness” over minimal length.

---

### 4.5 .dev TLD fits audience and scope

- The **`.dev`** TLD signals that the site targets **developers**.
- The content is technically focused: AI agents for code, dev workflows, tests, refactors, monorepos, etc.
- This reduces confusion with non-technical “agents” (real estate, insurance, travel), which would be more common with a generic `.com`.

**Consequence:** `.dev` helps set expectations and filters the audience toward developers.

---

## 5. Non-goals

- The domain is **not** optimized for broad consumer traffic or SEO around generic “agents” (e.g., real estate / travel).
- The domain is **not** intended to be a generic AI brand for all types of agents (chat, support, sales); the focus is on **coding/dev agents**.
- The decision does **not** preclude adding subpaths or subprojects later (guides, news, playbooks) under the same domain.

---

## 6. How the domain should be used in branding

### 6.1 Recommended hero usage

- **Title example:**
  > Pick your coding agent with confidence

- **Subtitle example:**
  > One comparison table for AI coding agents — with clear explanations why each feature matters for modern development.

### 6.2 Tagline direction

Optional taglines consistent with the decision:

- “Understand the features. Pick your agent.”
- “Compare AI coding agents, feature by feature.”
- “Pick your agent based on how you really work.”

---

## 7. Future considerations

- If the project later expands beyond coding agents (e.g., other developer AI tools), the domain still makes sense: the user is “picking their agent(s)” within the dev ecosystem.
- If a separate consumer-facing brand is needed in the future, this domain can remain the **developer-focused hub** for detailed comparisons and feature breakdowns.

---

## 8. Final status

- **Primary domain:** `pickyouragent.dev`  
- **Status:** **Selected and adopted** as the canonical domain for the project.
