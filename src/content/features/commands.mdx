## Commands
One-click access to your favorite prompts!

We all have some tasks we perform repeatedly. For example, my top one is `/commit`. You can write a command like:

```text
Analyze the changes
Describe what task has been solved and why these changes are needed
Create a commit message and show it to me. Await my approval
Commit the changes
```

This command helps automate my routine. You can create any command you need—it's simply a shortcut, nothing more. There's no special magic.

Commands can also help you integrate other tools into your workflow.
For example, [GitHub's spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) and [Fission-AI OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) integrate custom prompts into your agent using commands.
