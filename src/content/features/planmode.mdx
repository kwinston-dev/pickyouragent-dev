# Plan mode

Let your agent craft the perfect prompt for you.

Plan mode (also known as architect mode) is a multistep workflow where:

1. The agent (LLM) creates a step-by-step plan for solving your task.
2. The agent executes each step in the plan, one by one.

### Why it works

Modern LLMs are now made to follow step-by-step instructions. You can see this in many press releases (like [GPT-5.1](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1/) or [Gemini](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/#plan-anything)), and in third-party tests like the [Scale AI leaderboard](https://scale.com/leaderboard/instruction_following).

Also, the [Aider benchmark](https://aider.chat/2024/09/26/architect.html) shows clear improvements in code quality when using architect (plan) mode.

There is no reason not to use this mode in your daily work.

### Why it matters

- You can review and approve the exact steps before execution.
- You can confirm that the LLM has correctly understood your intent.
- You can edit and refine the workflow ahead of time.
- You save time because a precise plan upfront means you won’t need to constantly correct the LLM during execution.
- You can run multiple tasks concurrently, since the LLM can complete each task without requiring your ongoing attention.

### How to use it

Cursor: open agent model and change "agent" to plan. You can also use Shift+Tab to rotate over the modes list

Codex: Not implemented

Claude Code: press Shift+Tab to choose a mode

### Multi-step Planning

Multi-step planning enables an agent to decompose a complex coding task into smaller, sequential steps before execution. Instead of attempting to solve everything at once, the agent creates a roadmap of actions.
