Connect to providers based on location/region.

Region tuning allows you to connect to provider endpoints based on your geographic location. This helps optimize response times by using endpoints closer to your location. For example, z.ai has mainland China endpoints and international endpoints. The China endpoints provide much better response times than international endpoints when accessed from mainland China.
