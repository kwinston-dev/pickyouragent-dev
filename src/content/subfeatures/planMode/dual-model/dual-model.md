Dual model lets you choose one AI model for planning and another for execution. This means you can use a smarter, more expensive model to plan the steps, but save money by using a cheaper model to carry out the tasks. Each model gets to do what it does best.

**Advantages:**

- Save money by not using an expensive model for every step
- Take advantage of different strengths—some models are better at planning, others at doing
