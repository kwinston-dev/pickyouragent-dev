Edit plans directly without running the model.

Make precise, targeted edits directly in the plan instead of running the model.

Sometimes we need to make changes to the plan. We could ask the model, "please, fix the plan: [proposed changes]." However, it's often easier and more efficient to edit the plan directly rather than try to get the model to interpret your intended changes.
