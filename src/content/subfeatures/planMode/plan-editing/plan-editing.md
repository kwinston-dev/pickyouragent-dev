Make precise, targeted edits directly in the plan instead of running the model

Sometimes we need to make changes to the plan. We could ask the model, "please, fix the plan: [proposed changes]." However, it's often easier and more efficient to edit the plan directly rather than try to get the model to interpret your intended changes.


### How to use it

Cursor: Available in plan mode - you can edit the plan steps directly in the interface before execution
