Browse the web, just like a human.

If you're a web developer or want to automate tasks, you can use the built-in browser feature. This approach is better than MCP browser integration because coding clients can target common actions directly—for example, "take a screenshot of the page [abc]."

**Supported agents:**

- Cursor (partial support). You can call a browser only in plan and agent modes. Ask and debug modes are not supported the browser tool. 

**Not supported:**

- Codex

**Not verified yet:**

- Claude code
