Browse the web just like a human.

If you're a web developer or want to automate tasks, you can use the built-in browser feature. This approach is better than MCP browser integration because coding clients can target common actions directly—for example, "take a screenshot of the page [abc]."

**Supported agents:**

- Cursor (partial support). You can call a browser only in plan and agent modes. Ask and debug modes are not supported the browser tool.

**Not supported agents:**

- Codex
- Kilo Code (The developer declares the support here https://kilo.ai/docs/features/browser-use) but I failed to connect Chrome instances to the agent

**Not verified yet:**
