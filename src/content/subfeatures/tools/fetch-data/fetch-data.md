Get real-time answers from any website.

You cannot just use `curl` or `wget` to fetch data from the web because most websites return a lot of irrelevant content, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The built-in tool should be able to download the data and extract the useful information, filtering out any unnecessary clutter or noise.
