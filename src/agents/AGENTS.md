# Agents Directory Documentation

## Overview

The `src/agents` directory contains the core data structures and feature definitions for AI agent comparison in the Pick Your Agent project. This directory manages feature sets for different AI coding agents and provides schema validation, data parsing, and aggregation capabilities for comparing agent capabilities.

## Feature and Subfeature File Network

### What is a Feature?

A feature represents a category of functionality that AI coding agents may or may not support. Each feature has:

- A display name (e.g., "Plan Mode", "Documentation")
- A slug identifier used in URLs (e.g., "planmode", "documentation")
- Main and secondary colors for UI display
- Zero or more subfeatures that represent specific capabilities within that category

Features can be simple (like "Commands") or complex with multiple subfeatures (like "Documentation" which includes filesystem, tree, multi-file, etc.).

### How to Find Feature Definitions

Feature definitions are located in the schema file at:

```
src/agents/featureSetSchema.ts
```

To find a feature:

1. Open `src/agents/featureSetSchema.ts`
2. Look for the `featureSetSchema` constant export near the bottom of the file
3. Find the feature object with the desired feature key (e.g., `planMode`, `documentation`, `tools`)
4. The feature's metadata includes: `name`, `mainColor`, `secondaryColor`, and `slug`

### How to Find Subfeature Descriptions

Each subfeature has a detailed markdown description file. The location follows this pattern:

```
src/content/subfeatures/<featureCategory>/<subfeatureName>/<filename>.md[dx]
```

Where:

- `<featureCategory>` matches the feature's slug (e.g., `planmode`, `documentation`, `tools`)
- `<subfeatureName>` matches the subfeature's key as defined in the schema
- `<filename>` matches the subfeature's key (typically the same as subfeatureName)
- Files can have either `.md` or `.mdx` extension

**To locate a subfeature description:**

1. First, find the subfeature in `src/agents/featureSetSchema.ts` by searching for its key
2. Look for the `resolveSubfeature()` call that loads this subfeature (these are at the top of the file, around lines 85-122)
3. The ID passed to `resolveSubfeature()` shows the path structure: `featureCategory/subfeatureName/filename`
4. Navigate to `src/content/subfeatures/` and follow that path structure

**Example:**

If you see this in `src/agents/featureSetSchema.ts`:

```typescript
const dualModelDesc = await resolveSubfeature("planmode/dual-model/dual-model");
```

The description file is located at:

```
src/content/subfeatures/planmode/dual-model/dual-model.md
```

### Feature Categories

The following feature categories are defined in the schema:

| Feature          | Slug             | Main Color | Secondary Color |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Plan Mode        | planmode         | #3b82f6    | #60a5fa         |
| Documentation    | documentation    | #8b5cf6    | #a78bfa         |
| Tools            | tools            | #06b6d4    | #22d3ee         |
| Commands         | commands         | #10b981    | #34d399         |
| CLI Calling      | cli-calling      | #f97316    | #fb923c         |
| Model Management | model-management | #ec4899    | #f472b6         |
| Agent Mode       | agent-mode       | #ef4444    | #f87171         |
| Subscriptions    | subscriptions    | #f43f5e    | #fb7185         |

### How to Get Feature Support for an Agent

To find what features an agent supports:

1. Open the agent's feature set file at `src/agents/<agentName>/featureSet.ts`
2. Read the exported agent object created with `declareSchema(meta, features)`
3. The `meta` property contains the agent's `id` and `name`
4. The `features` property maps feature keys to status values

For features with subfeatures, the status is an object mapping subfeature keys to their individual status values. For simple features (like Commands), the status is a single value.

### Example: Finding Claude Code's Feature Support

**Goal:** Find what features Claude Code supports

**Step 1:** Open `src/agents/claudeCode/featureSet.ts`

**Step 2:** Read the exported `claudeCode` object to see support for each feature:

- `planMode` shows subfeature statuses like "dual-model": `SubFeatureStatus.Supported`
- `commands` shows `FeatureStatus.Supported` (single value, no subfeatures)
- `modelManagement` shows `filtering: SubFeatureStatus.NotSupported`

**Step 3:** Interpret the values using the status enums (see Status Values section above).

## Status Values

### FeatureStatus Enum

Used for simple features that don't have subfeatures.

| Value                | Meaning                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Supported`          | The feature is fully supported                   |
| `PartiallySupported` | The feature is partially supported               |
| `NotSupported`       | The feature is not supported                     |
| `NotVerified`        | The feature support status has not been verified |

### SubFeatureStatus Enum

Used for individual subfeatures within a feature.

| Value                | Meaning                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Supported`          | The subfeature is fully supported                   |
| `PartiallySupported` | The subfeature is partially supported               |
| `NotSupported`       | The subfeature is not supported                     |
| `NotVerified`        | The subfeature support status has not been verified |

## Feature Display Types

These values are used in the UI to display feature support status to users, providing clear visual feedback about each agent's capabilities.

### yes

Indicates that a feature is fully supported by the agent. Users can expect complete functionality with no limitations for this feature. This is represented visually as a green checkmark or a "Yes" label in comparison tables and feature lists.

### partial

Indicates that a feature is partially supported by the agent. The agent provides some functionality in this category, but with limitations, incomplete implementation, or reduced capabilities compared to full support. This is represented visually as a yellow indicator or "Partial" label.

### no

Indicates that a feature is not supported by the agent. The agent does not provide any functionality in this category. This is represented visually as a red X or "No" label.

### with-subfeatures

Indicates that a feature contains multiple subfeatures that should be displayed individually. This is used for complex features where different aspects need to be evaluated separately. Users can expand or drill into the feature to see support status for each subfeature.

## Feature Status Calculation

### Determining Display Type

The display type for a feature is determined as follows:

- **with-subfeatures**: If the feature schema has any subfeatures defined (non-empty subfeatures object)
- **yes/partial/no**: If the feature schema has no subfeatures (empty subfeatures object), the display type matches the feature's status value directly

### Aggregating Subfeature Status to Feature Status

When a feature has subfeatures, its overall status is calculated by aggregating all subfeature statuses for a given agent:

| Subfeature Combination         | Feature Status                    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| All subfeatures = Supported    | Supported                         |
| All subfeatures = NotVerified  | NotVerified                       |
| All subfeatures = NotSupported | PartiallySupported (special case) |
| Mix of different statuses      | PartiallySupported                |

**Note:** When all subfeatures are `NotSupported`, the feature status becomes `PartiallySupported` rather than `NotSupported`. This indicates the feature category exists but has no working functionality.

### Links Feature Type

The "subscriptions" feature stores external URLs (documentation, pricing, blogs, etc.) specific to each agent. Unlike other features, links features don't have subfeatures - each agent defines its own unique array of links.

#### SubscriptionLink Type

```typescript
type SubscriptionLink = {
  label: string; // Display name (e.g., "Pricing", "Documentation")
  url: string; // Full URL
};
```

#### Adding Subscriptions to an Agent

In the agent's `featureSet.ts`:

```typescript
import {
  declareSchema,
  FeatureStatus,
  SubFeatureStatus,
} from "../featureSetSchema";
import type { SubscriptionLink } from "../featureSetSchema";

export const myAgent = declareSchema(
  {
    id: "my-agent",
    name: "My Agent",
  },
  {
    // ... other features
    subscriptions: [
      { label: "Pricing", url: "https://agent.com/pricing" },
      { label: "Documentation", url: "https://agent.com/docs" },
    ],
  },
);
```

To mark an agent as not supporting subscriptions:

```typescript
subscriptions: FeatureStatus.NotSupported,
```

To have an agent with no subscriptions (empty state):

```typescript
subscriptions: [],
```

#### Feature Schema

The `subscriptions` feature is defined in `featureSetSchema.ts` with three possible value types:

1. `FeatureStatus` enum - displays a Badge component (e.g., for "NotSupported")
2. `SubscriptionLink[]` array - displays a vertical list of links
3. Empty subfeatures object `{}` - required by schema but not used for display

#### Content Files

Links features do not require subfeature markdown files. Only the main feature category file is needed:

```
src/content/features/subscriptions.mdx
```

#### Display

In the comparison table:

- Agents with link arrays: displays each link as a clickable element in a vertical list
- Agents with `FeatureStatus.NotSupported`: displays "✕ no" badge
- Agents with empty arrays: displays empty cell (or derived status badge)

### Mapping to Status Values

| Display Type       | Mapped To                                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yes`              | `FeatureStatus.Supported` or `SubFeatureStatus.Supported`                   |
| `partial`          | `FeatureStatus.PartiallySupported` or `SubFeatureStatus.PartiallySupported` |
| `no`               | `FeatureStatus.NotSupported` or `SubFeatureStatus.NotSupported`             |
| `with-subfeatures` | Features that have subfeature objects (not a single enum value)             |

## Agent Directories

Each agent has its own directory containing a `featureSet.ts` file that defines the agent's capabilities using the schema.

Each agent directory should also contain an `AGENTS.md` file with a URL to the agent's official documentation. This helps developers quickly find the documentation for each agent.

Available agents:

- `claudeCode/` - Claude Code agent
- `codex/` - Codex agent
- `cursor/` - Cursor agent
- `kiloCode/` - Kilo Code agent

## Core Files

### featureSetSchema.ts

The central schema definition file that establishes the type system for all agent feature sets. Defines the `featureSetSchema` Zod schema, feature and subfeature registries, status enums, and the `declareSchema()` factory function for creating typed agent feature sets.

### allAgents.ts

Central export file that aggregates all agent definitions into a single array. This is the main entry point for accessing all agent feature sets in the application.

### parsedTable.ts

Provides data structures and parsing logic for transforming raw agent feature sets into a structured, queryable format for comparison tables. Includes `ParsedSubfeature`, `ParsedFeature`, and `ParsedTable` classes.

## Usage in the Broader Project

The agents directory integrates with Astro's content collection system:

1. **Subfeature Descriptions**: Each subfeature references a markdown file in `src/content/subfeatures/` via the [`resolveSubfeature()`](src/agents/featureSetSchema.ts:41) function
2. **Content Schema**: The [`src/content/config.ts`](src/content/config.ts:1) defines the `subfeatures` collection with `featureName` and `subfeatureName` frontmatter fields
3. **Markdown Resolution**: At build time, markdown files are resolved and linked to their corresponding subfeature schemas

### Typical Usage Pattern

```typescript
// Import all agents
import { allAgents } from "./agents/allAgents";
import { ParsedTable } from "./agents/parsedTable";

// Create a parsed table for comparison
const table = new ParsedTable(allAgents);

// Get all features
const features = table.getFeatures();

// Get a specific feature
const planMode = table.getFeature("planmode");

// Get subfeatures of a feature
const subfeatures = planMode?.getSubfeatures();
```

## Adding a New Agent

To add a new agent to the system:

1. Create a new directory: `src/agents/<agentName>/`
2. Create `featureSet.ts` with the agent's feature status definitions
3. Import and add the agent to [`allAgents.ts`](src/agents/allAgents.ts:1)
4. The agent will automatically be included in comparisons via the [`ParsedTable`](src/agents/parsedTable.ts:157) class

Example:

```typescript
// src/agents/newAgent/featureSet.ts
import {
  declareSchema,
  FeatureStatus,
  SubFeatureStatus,
} from "../featureSetSchema";

export const newAgent = declareSchema(
  {
    id: "new-agent",
    name: "New Agent",
  },
  {
    planMode: {
      "dual-model": SubFeatureStatus.Supported,
      // ... other subfeatures
    },
    // ... other features
  },
);
```

Then in `allAgents.ts`:

```typescript
import { newAgent } from "./newAgent/featureSet";

export const allAgents: Agent[] = [
  cursor,
  claudeCode,
  codex,
  kiloCode,
  newAgent,
];
```
